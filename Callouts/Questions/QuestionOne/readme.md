I practiced in QuestionOne about how polymorphism concept can be implemented in golang for that I have created a Interface called Geometry,
and add three functions properties in it Area(), Perimeter() and Type()

then I defined some structs in seperate files like Circle, rectangle ,square and added those Geomatry interface's methods (Area,Perimeter and Type) in these structs


then i call them from main.go ( QuestionOne/Polymorphism/main.go ) and print values by calling methods
