to solve this knapsack problem I implemented the solution of dynamic programming ( Tabulation approach ) solution by exploring from videos

Because we cannot devide any item into fractions in this question I find this solution much easier

I filled a table with corresponding weight and profit and then filter and fill them based on maximum profit

I used a formula to calculate the value of particular Index of table (I found in a youtube video)

then store items that should be packed in bag in "itemThatWillBePacked" variable
